# HTML5 Mic Visualizer

This page uses the HTML5 [`AudioContext.createAnalyser()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/createAnalyser) API to visualize the input audio of your device microphone.

A demo page can be found [here](https://yige.ch/static/html5-mic/). It works in modern versions of desktop browsers, as well as in iOS and Android.

Note: The dB value on the page varies from your device microphone, and should not be considered as an accurate representation of your environment sound pressure.
